  "description": "At Argo, we are looking to serve as an activist operator for a handful of AVS ecosystems. Our activist approach means that AVS teams can lean on us as research partners, as they design and stress-test their staking networks. Furthermore, to support our AVS partners, we are building monitoring tools, such as real-time surveillance to assess operator activities and detect deviations from expected behavior. If you are interested in working with us, please refer to the contact information below",
